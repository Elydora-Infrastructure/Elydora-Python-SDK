# Elydora Python SDK Engineering Contract

## Scope

This repository owns the published `elydora` package, its CLI, synchronous and asynchronous API clients, local signing behavior, generated hook runtimes, and Python-specific agent adapters.

## Integration Sources

- Verify every agent hook contract against current official provider documentation before changing an adapter.
- Treat `../Elydora-Open-Source/integrations/catalog.json` as the cross-product provider inventory.
- Keep adapter delivery claims aligned with executable tests in this repository.
- Synchronize completed provider behavior into the Node SDK, Go SDK, Open Source distribution, Console, Docs, and landing page through separate reviewed commits.

## Hook Adapter Invariants

- Preserve unrelated user configuration and remove only Elydora-owned entries.
- Parse every affected user configuration before the first write.
- Surface malformed or unreadable configuration with contextual errors and leave the original file intact.
- Write configuration through a same-directory temporary file followed by an atomic replace.
- Quote the current Python executable and generated script paths for the host shell.
- Forward official hook JSON from STDIN without reshaping provider fields.
- Use the provider's documented blocking mechanism. Command-hook providers that define exit code `2` must receive exit code `2` from the freeze guard.
- Report installation as healthy only when a complete hook contract references both generated runtime scripts and both scripts exist.
- Model stable, legacy, and early-access hook generations as explicit contracts. Keep their activation requirements visible in CLI output and README guidance.
- Select Kimi Code and legacy kimi-cli config targets from existing runtime evidence; a fresh installation targets current Kimi Code and keeps migration markers isolated to active runtimes.
- Keep Grok Build writes inside its native global `$GROK_HOME/hooks/*.json` contract. Treat Claude Code and Cursor compatibility files plus project `.grok/hooks` as read-only integration sources.
- Write Auggie hooks only to `~/.augment/settings.json`; keep system and workspace settings read-only. Generate `.cmd` wrappers on Windows and `.sh` wrappers on Unix because Auggie dispatches supported script paths, and express hook timeouts in milliseconds.
- Validate Auggie matcher syntax during installation with Node.js `new RegExp`; keep status and uninstall independent from the JavaScript validator so recovery remains available offline.
- Write Cline hooks only to `$CLINE_DIR/hooks` with `~/.cline/hooks` as the default; keep Documents and workspace hook roots read-only. Preserve official input byte-for-byte, resolve Python runtimes from their absolute shebangs, and translate guard exit code `2` into Cline's JSON stdout cancellation control.

## Code Quality

- Support every Python version declared in `pyproject.toml`.
- Keep production source files at or below 500 lines.
- Keep functions focused on one ownership boundary.
- Propagate unexpected errors to the CLI boundary.
- Use documented defaults only for genuinely optional configuration.
- Avoid compatibility shims without a named public or user configuration contract.

## Verification

Run the focused adapter test during development, then execute all release gates before commit:

```powershell
py -3 -m pytest tests/test_<provider>_plugin.py -q
py -3 -m pytest -q
py -3 -m mypy elydora
py -3 -m pip check
py -3 -m pip wheel . --no-deps --wheel-dir <temporary-directory>
git diff --check
```

Provider adapter tests must cover installation, idempotency, official event forwarding, blocking behavior, status, missing runtime files, uninstall ownership, and malformed configuration preservation.

Commit and push one root issue before starting the next one.
